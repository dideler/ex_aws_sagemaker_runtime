## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.1] - 2020-05-28

The package was removed from its previous organisation. In order to keep the
source code public for a package that's still available on Hex, the project
has been forked and is now hosted under the original author's GitHub namespace.
This is in accordance with its MIT license.

The source code was recoverable from Hex, but unfortunately the Git history wasn't.

## [1.0.0] - 2019-06-29

First public release.

### Added

- Basic support for the InvokeEndpoint API
